# Alzheimer
Alzheimer is a brain disease which changes the brain in a destructive and negative way. And is common under the elderly people, around 6 million people are affected in the us and their age is often above 65.

## The effects
The effects are noumerous, but in first order, your brain affected. Cognitive and functional abilities like a persons ability to think, remember an communicate.
Physical abilities, interests and day-to-day tasks may also be impacted.

## What happens to the brain
In case of alzheimer the brain shrinks more than the healthy and natural percentage. The damage is widespread and neurons stop functioning, loose connections and die.

Here you can look at a comparison of a healthy brain and a brain impacted by severe Alzheimer's.

These changes may begin a decade before the symptoms show up. In early stages, the brains go through toxic changes. The result of Alzheimer are amyloid plaques, a unnatural buildup of proteines, dying of neurons and shrinkage. 

# stages of alzheimer
There are stages in the proccess of alzheimer, there is the mild stage, moderate stage and severe alzheimer.

## Mild stage
the mild stage the effects slightly show up and are often not recognised. The effects include greater memory loss and cognitive difficulties.

## Moderate stage
the moderate stage, in this stage the damage extends to areas in the brain that control language reasoning, even more memory loss and confusion. 

## Severe station
the last stage, plaques and tangles spread throughout the brain tissue shrinks even more and people may not communicate and become completely dependant. Near to the death of the person, the person is in bed most of the time as the body shuts down.

# the effects on sleep of alzheimer

People with Alzheimer’s may not sleep well at night but sleep excessively during the day.

Researchers thinks that Alzheimer causes cellular changes in the brain, which also affects the circadian rhythm the same thing affected when aging. Individuals with Alzheimer may have damaged SCN cells, the master clock in our brain, ending in difficulties to follow a typical sleep-wake-cycle.
as mentioned previously the Beta-amyloids they are extremely toxic. But while sleeping, these amyloids are reduced. In a study, after an Individual stayed up 31 hours, the amyloids increased by 5%. A lack of sleep may, therefore, contribute to Alzheimer’s.

People with Alzheimer's or dementia often sleep more and more as the disease progresses, and may also sleep during the day. Alzheimer's and dementia can cause increased sleep, reduced sleep quality, and less exposure to sun and physical movement. A 2015 study found that rats sleeping on their side may remove brain waste more efficiently, but this needs to be studied more.

# Dementia

Dementia is an umbrella term for some types of dementia, it is including diseases with brain issues such as memory loss, …. One of the most known types is Alzheimer, but there are other types such as Vascular dementia, dementia with Lewd bodies (DLB) frontotemporal dementia(FTD).

Dementia is progressive and has different types, the stages are often divided into three parts
- the early, mild stage
- the middle, moderate stage
- the late, severe stage

## Causes of dementia
Dementia can be caused by lots of things, such as dying nerve cells, Alzheimer's disease(and the other types under the term of dementia), severe head injuries and inherited dementia. Dementia can also be caused by sleep issues, different types of dementia are associated with different sleep problems.


## Some effects on sleeping of Dementia
A person with dementia migth sleep not well due to:
- have difficulty getting to sleep
- wake up several times during the night
- sleep less deeply
- sleep for less time overall
- Medication
- Melatonin
- being inactive and bored
- being confused at night
- ...
All these causes to poor quality sleep can interfer with the bodies internal clock. This internal clock is also affected by the degeneration of the 'main clock' in the brain.

# What happens to the brain when aging?
As a person gets older, some changes occur in all parts of our bodies, including the brain. The changes range from shrinking, dying neutrons, decreasing blood flow, …

## How does neurons are affected and die?
Normally, neurons react adaptively to oxidative stress and bioenergetic challenges. However, in aging or degenerative disorders, these mechanisms are compromised, resulting in more susceptibility to brain diseases.
The ability to repair DNA damage in the neurons declines with age, and the result is dying neurons. 

You could compare the loss of coordination with a building site, where an old building is torn down. The building of a new building is delayed due to a shortage of workers and or building material. The building site, is the DNA repair job, and incomplete, they are toxic to the neuron, causing even more degeneration.

## what happens to the brains size
it has been found out that the brain shrinks 5% each decade, and the pace increases as the person gets older. The shrinking is caused from dying neurons.

## the effects on sleep of aging

It is common that the quality of sleeps of older adults experiences a heavy decrease. These changes often occure because of changements in the circadian clock, the "master clock" in our brain. The deterioration of cells impacts this "master clock" and can also lead to the disruption of the circadian rythm. This impacts when people get hungry, when the body releases certain hormones, when a person feels sleepy or alert, etc.

Other changes include changes in production of hormones, such as melatonin and cortisone, which also can play a role in disrupted sleep of elder people. 

The sleep architecture also changes, adults wake up frequenter. Older adults spend much more time inn the earlier lighter phase, which can also lead to fragmented sleep.

That older people need less sleep as younger people is true, to a certain point. In fact, contrary to popular opinion, older people don't need less sleep than younger people in their 20s. Adults require the same amount of sleep from their 20s into old age. The National Sleep Foundation guidelines, recommend that people over 65 years should get over 8 hours of sleep.
