Fifa's decision to award Qatar the contest was controversial even in 2010. But with revelations over the treatment of migrant workers and the spotlighting of its anti-gay laws, concern has steadily mounted. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and 2018 World Cup did not bring rights improvements in Russia or China. Saudi Arabia is determined to win an Olympics. Allegations of corruption have long dogged the International Olympic Committee. Several national captains will wear rainbow armbands to support anti-discrimination campaign. The challenge posed by sportswashing won't truly be addressed unless international governing bodies undergo fundamental changes.

As most of us know the FIFA World Cup is a worldwide competition that happens every 4 years. Competition to host these events is normally fierce, as taking the FIFA World Cup to a country leads enormous economic gains through tourism, trade, broadcasting, foreign exchange, logistics etc., and is also a basis of great prestige for a current government. Countries that given the opportunity to host world cup by FIFA must portray the ability to control huge human and vehicle traffic. This mean that the country should have sufficient infrastructure, which include world-class roads, hotels, and sufficient power supply among many others, but in the case of Qatar this is not the case.



According to theguardian.com, 15.021 migrant workers have died in construction in the span of 9 years, since Qatar won the voting of the FIFA by bribing. This is mainly due to the working conditions: no adequate safety equipment for working at heights and no protection from the intense heat and sunlight. Heart failure is therefore a frequent cause of death. 
That would be bad enough, but the workers were often forced to operate in dreadful conditions.

It's impossible to disagree. The Qatar 2022 organizing committee have issued a charter apparently guaranteeing the safety of its workers on the construction site, but one doubts whether the situation will improve dramatically, and the damage has surely already been done.
This will be a World Cup built on blood and played on corpses.
