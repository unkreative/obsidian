As most of us know the FIFA World Cup is a worldwide competition that happens every 4 years. Competition to host these events is normally fierce, as taking the FIFA World Cup to a country leads enormous economic gains through tourism, trade, broadcasting, foreign exchange, logistics etc., and is also a basis of great prestige for a current government. Countries that given the opportunity to host world cup by FIFA must portray the ability to control huge human and vehicle traffic. This mean that the country should have sufficient infrastructure, which include world-class roads, hotels, and sufficient power supply among many others, but in the case of Qatar this is not the case.
