# The most important thing(essay 1, nOt GoOd EnOuGh)
When it comes to life, many things are important to us. Our family, our friends, as well as school and even our hobbies (running, playing an instrument). However the most important thing for us can either be, staying at home and having a nice, chill time, or even going to parties, where the music is loud and everyone is having a great time dancing. Our mission for this essay is to reflect on what our interests are, and what to consider what is important in our life and what we want to take forward with it.

For most people, we can assume that family and friends might be their most important thing in their lives. For other people, money and wealth are very important to them. At the end of the day, if we were to be stuck on an island, what would we prefer? Material things, or family. This is one of the questions we can take in perspective in order to find out what really matters in life. 

An other question we might have to ask ourselves is, where is home? Is home the place where we keep our belongings, like our furniture, family photos, wealthy possession? Or is home, the place where you are when you’re with a loved one, a friend, a family member? For instance, home, and “the most important thing in life” is extremely subjective and every different answer can be different but is validated, because every person has their background, their story, their life…

Lastly, as said in the last paragraph, there are many people in this world, with different views on life, on politics, on people… Every one of these people have a different age, different culture, different backgrounds, but also different goals and different challenges they have to face in life, in order to feel “successful”.

Coming to our conclusion, we realised that words like “challenge”, “success”, “most important thing in life”, have such a big power behind them, but at the same moment, don’t even mean anything. Every person takes those words differently, interprets them differently, and takes them with them differently. That’s why, we don’t find it important and relevant to say what “our most important thing” in life is, but it is important for us to acknowledge that every different answer from that question from every single different person is valuable. 

# essay 2 (to offend)
When it comes to life, many things are important to us. Our family, our friends, as well as school and even our hobbies (running, playing an instrument). However, for us, the most important thing is to have money. In this essay, we are going to present why we find money to be so important to us and why you should think like that too.

Money is the source of society and extremely important to every culture, country, religion. Everywhere we go, we need money and anything we might want (food, place to stay in, attraction, education), we also have to possess money. No matter what land, or what currency, money stays important in society.

Of course, there are financial aids for people in need, in order for some people to get an education or to get right back on track with their lives. Furthermore, that’s why we pay taxes, in order to help every one to have a minimum of support and a minimum of standards to live.

We find money to be a necessity in today’s society and we can’t imagine a place without it. No matter if the next years following, we shift a little into communism, or we stay in capitalism, money will always be around and have a great power above our lives.

That is why we find money to be the most important thing for us, as we have to have it in order to live and survive.
