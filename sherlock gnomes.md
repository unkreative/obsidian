# Arthur Conan Doyle
Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh on 22 May 1859. His father Charles Altamont Doyle was an artist and suffered from alcoholism. His mother Mary Doyle was a reader and storyteller. At the age of ten, he was sent to a strict Jesuit boarding school in England and spent seven years there until he graduated. There he also discovered his aptitude for storytelling and made up entertaining stories for the younger pupils.

After graduating in 1876, he returned to his homeland. There he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he met his teacher, Dr. Joseph Bell. The Scottish doctor is considered as a pioneer of forensic medicine till this day. He recognized and taught the importance of observation, logic and deduction for the diagnosis of diseases and for the work of pathology. Doyle was so fascinated by Bell's abilities that he gave them to his character Sherlock Holmes.

While in his medical studies, in 1879, Doyle published his short story "The Mystery of Sasassa Valley" in a magazine. In 1881 he graduated and eventually settled in Portsmouth to open his first practice. Gradually the practice became a success and a comfortable income. In August 1885 he married Louisa Hawkins.

In March 1886 Conan Doyle began writing his book "A study in Scarlet". Two years later, he published his book, which became such great success, that the edition sold out immediately. Doyle went on to write a series of historical novels, poetry and plays.

Doyle published his next novel in 1890 under the title "The Sign of Four", which was also a great success. He wrote another series of short stories about Sherlock Holmes and signed a contract with a famous publisher and printed the stories for decades, which made Doyle even more famous. After a serious illness, Doyle decided to give up his medical career and devote himself entirely to writing.

A year later, he decided to get rid of his famous detective and had Sherlock Holmes die in “The Final Problem” in 1893. As a result, he lost many readers. But Doyle felt liberated from the pressures that came with the fame. After his wife was diagnosed with tuberculosis, Doyle did everything he could to keep her alive. It is likely that the despair over his wife's illness plunged him into a depression, based of which he turned further and further to spiritualism.

In 1900, after the outbreak of the Boer War, Doyle volunteered as a doctor and set off for Africa. He wrote down his experiences in his work “The Great Boer War”. After returning from the war, he wrote the novel “The Hound of the Baskervilles”, but it was missing a hero, so he made it a Sherlock Holmes adventure. But he made the story look like an earlier, yet unknown case, so as not to have to bring the detective back from the dead. 

After the death of his wife in 1906, Doyle fell into a depression and, to distract himself, he tried himself as a detective, by offering his services to Scotland Yard. He assisted in the investigation of the case of George Edalji, who had been wrongly convicted of mutilating several animals, and was eventually able to prove his innocence. In 1909, Doyle wrote a polemic on the plunder and enslavement of the Congo.

In 1907, Doyle married Jean Leckie. They had three children.

After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Doyle volunteered again as a military doctor, but was rejected. He became involved by forming a civilian battalion. At the end of 1917, Doyle's new Sherlock Holmes novel His Last Bow was published. Two years later, Doyle was given permission to visit the front and act as a war observer. He saw the atrocities of war at close quarters and experienced them first hand as his son, brother, both brothers-in-law and both nephews fell in battle. After these cruel experiences, he was drawn back to spiritualism.

He published another book and his last two Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1929 he was diagnosed with heart disease. On the morning of 7th July 1930, Doyle died. His grave is still preserved in a cemetery in the small English village of Minstead.



# Chapter 1 to 5
The first appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson is in their home office at 221b Baker Street in London. Watson examines a mysterious cane left in the office by an unknown visitor, and Holmes sits with his back facing his friend. Holmes asks Watson what he makes of it, and Watson declares that his friend must "have eyes in the back of his head," since he saw what he was doing. Holmes admits that he saw Watson's reflection in the coffee service, proving to Watson and us that he is an astute observer.

The inscription "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H." suggests an elderly doctor who was given the walking stick after years of faithful service, according to Watson's theory. Holmes empowers Watson's hypothesis, and the specialist keeps, saying that the very much worn stick suggests a country expert who strolls about a lot. Additionally, he suggests that the C.C.H. is most likely the mark of "the something hunt," a local group to which Mortimer rendered some assistance.

Mortimer gives Holmes and Watson a manuscript that Holmes had already noticed, dated at 1730, and Mortimer gives it to them. The legend of the Baskerville curse is revealed in the 1742 document known as Baskerville Hall. According to Mortimer, Hugo Baskerville ruled over Devonshire's Baskerville mansion during the "Great Revolution." The notorious Hugo was sexually obsessed and lecherous, and one day he kidnapped a local yeoman's daughter. The girl escaped with the assistance of an ivy-covered wall after being trapped in an upstairs room and hearing the boisterous drinking and carousing going on downstairs. She ran outside across the vast moorlands. Hugo made a deal with the devil and sent his hounds after the young girl, enraged that his captive had escaped. The bodies of Hugo and his girl had been discovered by Hugo's companions after they had followed their drunken friend across the moorland. Hugo had just had "a foul thing, a great, black beast" slit his throat. Mortimer says that ever since, the supernatural hound has been following the family. The newest resident of Baskerville Hall, Sir Charles Baskerville, was killed by the hound just recently.

# Chapter 5 to 10
Henrys hotel is where Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson arrive for lunch. Holmes pretends to look at the register and asks the receptionist about the other guests. He comes to the conclusion that the individual who sent Sir Henry the warning is not staying at his hotel. 

The young man reveals that another boot, this one from an older pair, was stolen as they approach Sir Henry's room. Dr. Mortimer mentions that the butler Barrymore at Baskerville Hall has a beard, and Holmes tells Sir Henry about the man who followed them with a beard. 

Holmes discovers during their discussion of Sir Charles's will that the bearded butler Barrymore and his wife were among the beneficiaries. Sir Henry, on the other hand, receives most of the estate. In order to confirm Barrymore's presence in Devonshire, Holmes sends a wire to Baskerville Hall and asks that only the butler receive it. 

Under a cabinet, curiously, Sir Henry discovers his lost new boot. Holmes asks Watson to go to Devonshire to protect Sir Henry because she becomes more and more convinced that something is going on. In order for Holmes, who is too preoccupied with other cases to leave London, to observe Watson's investigation from afar, regular reports are requested. 

Holmes receives a cable confirming that Barrymore is indeed at Baskerville Hall after returning to Baker Street. The taxi driver tells Sherlock Holmes that Cartwright's fare was a bearded man named Sherlock Holmes when he returns without any newspaper fragments. Holmes is amused and suggests that the man is communicating with him personally. 

Summary of Chapter 6 Holmes, asks Watson to look into the villagers and report back to him before he leaves. For safety's sake, Dr. Watson takes his gun. 

Watson finds out when he arrives in Devonshire that it is believed that a fugitive killer is hiding on the moor. Sir Henry takes note of Watson's observation of the gloomy moor and Watson's admiration of the landscape as they travel to Baskerville Hall. Sir Henry promises to install lights as he approaches the manor to dispel the gloom. 

Dr. Mortimer goes home upon arrival, while Sir Henry and Watson meet the butler, Barrymore. In awe of his family's past, Sir Henry looks at the wall portraits. Given the melancholy atmosphere in Baskerville Hall, Sir Henry acknowledges his uncle's anxiety during dinner. Watson hears a woman crying that night. 

Summary of Chapter 7.
Watson and Sir Henry agree that in sunlight, the manor's atmosphere appears less ominous the next morning, but they both heard a woman sob the night before. However, Mrs. Barrymore's eyes are red and swollen, as if she had just cried, when Watson comes across them. Watson decides to make sure that the trick Holmes used to determine that Barrymore was in Devonshire actually worked as planned after pondering why Barrymore would lie and why his wife would cry. The postmaster's messenger, on the other hand, reveals that he gave Mrs. Barrymore the cable instead. 

Watson meets Jack Stapleton, an entomologist on the lookout for butterflies, as he makes his way back to Baskerville Hall.

At the point when Stapleton pursues a butterfly, his sister, an extraordinary marvel, who seems to be her sibling, botches Watson for Sir Henry and cautions him to leave the region. Chapter 8: Watson discovers that Stapleton was a schoolmaster at Merripit House. Although Holmes only asked for the facts, Watson begins his report by describing the bleak and lonely moor. Watson continues, "The escaped convict has probably fled the area because he could not survive for that long without food." Beryl Stapleton's brother does not appear to agree with the romantic interest Sir Henry appears to have developed in her. Watson adds that Sir Henry apologized to Barrymore for asking him where he was when Holmes's cable arrived by giving him his old tweed suit. Despite Barrymore's wife's continued distress, Watson maintains his suspicion of her. Dr. Watson also says he met Mr. Frankland, a friendly but litigious man who uses a telescope to look for the escaped convict on the moor. 

Watson sees Barrymore sneaking into a room on the second floor with a candle in hand, the same night he hears footsteps passing by his room. Chapter 9 According to Watson's second letter home, the room where Barrymore went missing directly overlooks the moor. Barrymore's nightly activities and his wife's tears could be explained by Watson's theory that he is having an affair with a country girl. A stakeout is planned by Watson and Sir Henry. 

For a rendezvous, Sir Henry and Beryl Stapleton meet. Watson observes Beryl's apparent resistance to his romantic advances as she follows him. Her brother arrives and reacts with rage just as Sir Henry moves in to kiss her. Given that Stapleton's sister is single, and Sir Henry is a good catch, his reaction seems inappropriate. Stapleton comes to Barrymore Hall later that evening to apologize for his outburst and invites them to Merripit House for dinner. 

Watson and Sir Henry confront Barrymore in the room with a view of the moor on the second night of their stakeout. Watson waves the candle to demonstrate that Barrymore is communicating with someone when Barrymore refuses to provide an explanation. The response is a dim yellow light far out in the moor. Mrs. Barrymore arrives, summoned by the commotion, and reveals that the escaped prisoner is Selden, her younger brother, and that they are signaling to him when they are ready to deliver food or clothing to him. 

To capture the prisoner and bring him to the authorities, Watson and Sir Henry head toward the dim light, but he manages to elude them. Watson sees the outline of a tall man perched atop a tor as they make their way back to Baskerville Hall. 

Chapter 10: On a gloomy day, Watson begins an excerpt from his diary by describing his sense of constant danger. He rejects the idea that his sense of dread might be due to the paranormal as Holmes's substitute, but he can't help but admit that the empirical world has no satisfactory explanation for the thing that baffles him: the moor's howls that can be heard. 

Barrymore reveals that he read the charred remnants of a letter that was sent to Sir Charles on the day of his death. The letter stated that Sir Charles was supposed to meet a woman named L.L. at 10 p.m. that night. This new wind in the secret prompts Watson to compose a letter to Holmes and to concede that he wants to be there. 

Watson contemplates the case while taking a stroll on the moor the following day, despite the rain and sadness. He meets Dr. Mortimer, who is looking for his dog, who has gone missing. He asks Dr. Mortimer about the letter's initials on a whim, and she tells him about Laura Lyons of Coombe Tracey, who, after a bad marriage, was able to start a typing business with Sir Charles's help. 

Barrymore informs Watson that Selden regards the man on the tor as a gentleman after seeing him among the stone huts. Watson, on the other hand, wonders if the man's sinister soul is filled with hatred because he is willing to hide in such an inhospitable location as the stone huts. He decides that finding out who the mysterious man on the tor is must be his new task.
# Chapter 10 to 15
Chapter 11. The Man on the Tor 

Watson pays Laura Lyons a visit. She acknowledges writing Sir Charles' letter. She claims that in order to meet Sir Charles before he left, she requested a private meeting that evening. She didn't go to Baskerville Hall even though she needed Sir Charles' financial assistance with her divorce because the support came from somewhere else that very evening.  

Laura Lyons gets the impression from Watson that she is concealing something. He encounters Frankland on his way to the stone cottages where he is hunting for the stranger. Over a bottle of wine at his home, Frankland bragged that he knew where the prisoner was hiding since he had observed a messenger boy bringing food to the stone cottages through his telescope. Watson bids the boy farewell and follows him to an abandoned cottage that appears to be habitable when he realises that the boy is bringing food to the stranger rather than the prisoner. He enters and looks about, discovering a message stating that Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey. He chooses to wait in a shadowy area of the cabin with his revolver drawn after becoming aware that he is being observed.  

After a brief interval, he hears footsteps and a voice addressing him specifically. 

Chapter 12. Death on the Moor 

Watson is concerned and demands an explanation when he realises the mystery man is none other than Sherlock Holmes. In order to conduct his own investigation, Holmes appears to have asked Watson to travel with Sir Henry. He clarifies that Laura Lyons and Stapleton are in a relationship and that the Stapletons are a married couple rather than being brother and sister. When Watson expresses scepticism, Holmes says that after learning from Watson's report that Stapleton had once been a schoolmaster, he had looked up someone who matched Stapleton's description in the educational system's records. Holmes claims that this man had a wife.  

Beryl Stapleton penned the warning, which Holmes confirms, proving that the Stapletons were the ones who followed Sir Henry to London. Given that they were dealing with murder the entire time, Holmes is even certain that Stapleton is the perpetrator. Sir Charles was lured to the gate on the moor by Stapleton using Laura Lyons, who then managed to scare him into fleeing and giving him a heart attack. Holmes says that he only has two more days to substantiate his suspicions and offer a reason.  

Screaming breaks up their exchange. When they finally emerge into the night, they discover a body at the base of a precipice. When they turn him over, they see it is Selden, who was dressed in the tweed suit Barrymore had given him. At first, they believe it is Sir Henry. He must have been evading something because he shattered his neck after falling down the cliff.  

Stapleton unexpectedly shows in and explains that he had come looking for Sir Henry because he hadn't shown up for dinner at Merripit House.  

Holmes informs Stapleton that he is departing for London the following day before they split up to head to their individual houses. 

Chapter 13. Fixing the Nets 

When Stapleton learns that Sir Henry is still alive, Holmes and Watson are impressed with his poise. Watson wants to go after him right away, but Holmes points out that they have no evidence yet. They must use Sir Henry as bait to accomplish this.  

Holmes notices an uncanny likeness between Sir Hugo and Stapleton in the portrait when he returns to Baskerville Hall and catches a glimpse of it. It is clear that he has figured out the motivation: Stapleton must be a family member who will take over the Baskerville estate if Sir Henry passes away.  

Holmes and Watson assert that Sir Henry must eat alone with Stapleton since they must return to London. Henry is concerned, but he vows to follow Holmes' instructions exactly: he will go to dinner, send his driver home, and then, thereafter, go by himself back across the moor to Baskerville Hall.  

Actually, Watson and Holmes visit Laura Lyons to question her once more. She admits everything when they let her know Stapleton is married. What to include in the letter to Sir Charles has been given to her by Stapleton. Stapleton warned her against meeting Sir Charles and let her know that he would pay for the divorce personally before she kept the appointment.  

Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard is expected any moment, according to a telegram received by Sherlock Holmes. 

Chapter 14. The Hound of the Baskervilles 

Lestrade is picked up by Holmes and Watson, who then head to the moor close to Merripit House to wait for Sir Henry after dinner. Watson is sent by Holmes to spy on the house, but all he finds is Henry and Stapleton conversing over coffee in the dining room after dinner. There is no sign of Beryl Stapleton. Watson hears scuffling inside the outhouse where Stapleton is using the restroom. Watson then makes a report as the unexpectedly quick-approaching fog. Holmes and his comrades retreat to a higher point above the fog because of fear that their plan may fall through if they are unable to see Sir Henry.  

A short while later, they witness Sir Henry go shortly before being engulfed by the fog. Then, as the tale foretells, an enormous dog with a muzzle that appears to spit fire bursts out of the mist and charges Sir Henry. They had been hearing the thunderous footsteps of a dog. In order to make the dog glow, Holmes kills the animal, which turns out to be a bloodhound mastiff with phosphorus in its mouth.  

As they approach the Merripit mansion to capture Stapleton, they leave Sir Henry alone because he is uninjured. However, they only discover Beryl Stapleton in a room upstairs, bound and gagged. She admits that despite being beaten, she loved and feared her husband but was unable to give her assent to Sir Henry's death. Stapleton has left for his refuge in Grimpen Mire, she informs them. They decide to pursue him the following day because he spends the entire night there due to the dense fog.  

Beryl takes Stapleton to Grimpen Mire the following day. The trail of Stapleton's footsteps abruptly ends where they only locate Sir Henry's old footwear. Holmes thinks Stapleton has become lost and has been sucked up by the moor. They locate the cottage where he kept the hound as they proceed. 

Chapter 15. A Retrospection 

Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer travel to Baker Street in London to get ready for a journey to help Sir Henry find his peace. Holmes explains how he solved the case as they discuss the circumstances that led to their meeting. Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of the three brothers, was the father of Stapleton. He wed the Costa Rican Beryl Garcia, and the two of them emigrated to England in order to avoid being found guilty of embezzlement. He founded a school in the north, and when it closed, he eventually moved to Devonshire. He made friends with Sir Charles after realising he was entitled to the inheritance; Sir Charles then confided in him and told him about the legend and his weak heart. Stapleton devised a cunning scheme.  

He hired Laura Lyons after his wife declined to assist him. While courting her and making marriage proposals, he actually used her to entice Sir Charles to the gate.  

Stapleton had to devise a strategy to get rid of the second heir after realising there was a third. He went to London with his wife to spy on Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer, but he was unaware that his wife was warning Sir Henry. In order to teach the dog Sir Henry's scent, he stole the boot. Realizing the first boot had never been worn, he was forced to steal the second.  

In addition, Holmes explains his own deception. Watson immediately suspected the Stapletons when he received a description of the neighbours because the warning to Sir Henry had smelled of perfume. His own research gave him the required hint and revealed their marital status. Beryl Stapleton was stuck in a violent marriage out of fear, but she was forced to leave him when she saw the dog and realised it was trying to murder Sir Henry.  

There is still one unanswered question: How could Stapleton have taken Sir Henry's riches without outing himself and raising suspicion if he had been successful in doing so? Holmes emphasises that it is hard to make assumptions about a man's potential future acti
