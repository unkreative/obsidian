# Arthur Conan Doyle
Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh on 22 May 1859. His father Charles Altamont Doyle was an artist and suffered from alcoholism. His mother Mary Doyle was a reader and storyteller. At the age of ten he was sent to a strict Jesuit boarding school in England and spent seven years there until he graduated. There he also discovered his aptitude for storytelling and made up entertaining stories for the younger pupils.

After graduating in 1876, he returned to his homeland. There he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he met his teacher Dr. Joseph Bell. The Scottish doctor is considered as a pioneer of forensic medicine till this day. He recognized and taught the importance of observation, logic and deduction for the diagnosis of diseases and for the work of pathology. Doyle was so fascinated by Bell's abilities that he gave them to his character Sherlock Holmes.

While his medical studies, in 1879, Doyle published his short story "The Mystery of Sasassa Valley" in a magazine. In 1881 he graduated and eventually settled in Portsmouth to open his first practice. Gradually the practice became a success and a comfortable income. In August 1885 he married Louisa Hawkins.

In March 1886 Conan Doyle began writing his book "A study in Scarlet". Two years later, he published his book, which became such great success, that the edition sold out immediately. Doyle went on to write a series of historical novels, poetry and plays.

Doyle published his next novel in 1890 under the title "The Sign of Four", which was also a great success. He wrote another series of short stories about Sherlock Holmes and signed a contract with a famous publisher and printed the stories for decades, which made Doyle even more famous. After a serious illness, Doyle decided to give up his medical career and devote himself entirely to writing.

A year later, he decided to get rid of his famous detective and had Sherlock Holmes die in “The Final Problem” in 1893. As a result, he lost many readers. But Doyle felt liberated from the pressures that came with the fame. After his wife was diagnosed with tuberculosis, Doyle did everything he could to keep her alive. It is likely that the despair over his wife's illness plunged him into a depression, based of which he turned further and further to spiritualism.

In 1900, after the outbreak of the Boer War, Doyle volunteered as a doctor and set off for Africa. He wrote down his experiences in his work “The Great Boer War”. After returning from the war, he wrote the novel “The Hound of the Baskervilles”, but it was missing a hero, so he made it a Sherlock Holmes adventure. But he made the story look like an earlier, yet unknown case, so as not to have to bring the detective back from the dead. 

After the death of his wife in 1906, Doyle fell into a depression and, to distract himself, he tried himself as a detective, by offering his services to Scotland Yard. He assisted in the investigation of the case of George Edalji, who had been wrongly convicted of mutilating several animals, and was eventually able to prove his innocence. In 1909, Doyle wrote a polemic on the plunder and enslavement of the Congo.

In 1907, Doyle married Jean Leckie. They had three children.

After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Doyle volunteered again as a military doctor but was rejected. He became involved by forming a civilian battalion. At the end of 1917, Doyle's new Sherlock Holmes novel His Last Bow was published. Two years later, Doyle was given permission to visit the front and act as a war observer. He saw the atrocities of war at close quarters and experienced them first hand as his son, brother, both brothers-in-law and both nephews fell in battle. After these cruel experiences, he was drawn back to spiritualism.

He published another book and his last two Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1929 he was diagnosed with heart disease. On the morning of 7th July 1930, Doyle died. His grave is still preserved in a cemetery in the small English village of Minstead.



# chapter 1 to 5
Our first glimpse of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson is in their home office at 221b Baker Street in London. Watson examines a mysterious cane left in the office by an unknown visitor, and Holmes sits with his back facing his friend. Holmes asks Watson what he makes of it, and Watson declares that his friend must "have eyes in the back of his head," since he saw what he was doing. Holmes admits that he saw Watson's reflection in the coffee service, proving to Watson and us that he is an astute observer.

Watson offers up his theory as to the origin of the walking stick, declaring that the inscription, "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.," suggests an elderly doctor who was awarded the object after years of faithful service. Holmes encourages Watson's speculation, and the doctor continues, saying that the well-worn stick implies a country practitioner who walks about quite a bit. In addition, the C.C.H., he suggests, is probably the mark of "the something hunt," a local group to whom Mortimer provided some service.

Mortimer presents Holmes and Watson with a manuscript which the always observant Holmes had already noticed and dated at 1730. The document, dated 1742, Baskerville Hall, reveals the myth of the Baskerville curse. At the time of the "Great Revolution," Mortimer reads, Hugo Baskerville lorded over the Baskerville mansion in Devonshire. Sex crazed and lecherous, the infamous Hugo became obsessed with a local yeoman's daughter, whom he kidnapped one day. Trapped in an upstairs room, hearing the raucous drinking and carousing going on downstairs, the girl escaped with the help of an ivy-covered wall. She fled across the expansive moorlands outside. Enraged at finding that his captive escaped, Hugo made a deal with the devil and released his hounds in pursuit of the young girl. Hugo's companions had followed their drunken friend across the moorland, and came upon the bodies of both Hugo and his girl. Hugo had just had his throat ripped out by "a foul thing, a great, black beast." Ever since, Mortimer reports, the supernatural hound has haunted the family. The hound just recently killed Sir Charles Baskerville, the latest inhabitant of Baskerville Hall.

# chapter 5 to 10
[Sherlock Holmes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Sherlock_Holmes) and [Dr. Watson](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Dr._Watson) arrive at Henry's hotel for lunch. Holmes glances at the register under a pretense and questions the receptionist about the other guests. He concludes that the person who sent the warning to Sir Henry is not staying at his hotel. 

As they arrive at Sir Henry's room, the young man discloses that another boot was stolen, this time one of an old pair. Holmes tells Sir Henry about the bearded man who followed them, and Dr. Mortimer mentions that the butler Barrymore at [Baskerville Hall](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/symbols/#Baskerville_Hall)has a beard. 

As they discuss Sir Charles's will, Holmes learns that several people were named as beneficiaries, among them the bearded butler Barrymore and his wife. The bulk of the estate, however, goes to Sir Henry. Now even more suspicious of Barrymore, Holmes sends a wire to Baskerville Hall, requesting that it be handed only to the butler to ascertain that he is in Devonshire. 

Curiously Sir Henry finds his lost new boot under a cabinet. Increasingly convinced that something is afoot, Holmes asks Watson to go to Devonshire to protect Sir Henry. Holmes, himself too busy with other cases to leave London, requests regular reports so he can follow Watson's investigation from afar. 

After returning to Baker Street, Holmes receives a cable stating that Barrymore is at Baskerville Hall indeed. Cartwright returns without any cut-up newspapers, and the cabbie shows up, telling Sherlock Holmes that his fare was a bearded man by the name of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is amused, suggesting that the man is sending him a personal message. 

Chapter 6 Summary 

Before Watson takes leave Holmes requests that Watson investigate the villagers and report back to him. [Dr. Watson](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Dr._Watson) takes his gun for protection. 

Upon arrival in Devonshire, Watson learns that an escaped killer is assumed to be hiding on the moor. As they travel to [Baskerville Hall](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/symbols/#Baskerville_Hall), Sir Henry admires the beauty of the landscape while Watson remarks upon the melancholy darkness of the moor. Approaching the manor, Sir Henry promises to install lights to dispel the ominous gloom about it. 

Upon arrival Dr. Mortimer goes home, while Sir Henry and Watson meet Barrymore, the butler. Sir Henry looks at the portraits on the wall, in awe of his family's history. During dinner Sir Henry expresses his understanding of his uncle's anxiety given the somber atmosphere in Baskerville Hall. That night Watson hears a woman sob. 

Chapter 7 Summary 

The next morning Watson and Sir Henry agree that in sunlight the atmosphere in the manor seems less ominous, and yet they both heard a woman sob the previous night. Barrymore claims that his wife was not crying, so they must be mistaken. But when Watson runs into Mrs. Barrymore, her eyes are red and swollen as if from crying. Watson wonders why Barrymore would lie and why his wife would cry and resolves to make sure that the trick Holmes used to ascertain that Barrymore was in Devonshire actually worked as planned. However, the postmaster's messenger reveals that he gave the cable to Mrs. Barrymore instead. 

On his way back to [Baskerville Hall](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/symbols/#Baskerville_Hall), Watson runs into [Jack Stapleton](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Jack_Stapleton), an entomologist out hunting butterflies. Stapleton knows about Holmes and Watson and seems interested in the case he must be investigating, yet Watson remains tightlipped. Stapleton describes the area, pointing out the Neolithic ruins of stone huts as well as the dangers of the moor. The danger of Grimpen Mire becomes palpable when they witness from afar as a pony drowns in the mire. Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by a loud moan. Stapleton suggests that the locals might ascribe the sound to the hound, yet he claims that it could just as well be the sound of a rare bird. 

When Stapleton runs after a butterfly, his sister, an exotic beauty, who looks nothing like her brother, mistakes Watson for Sir Henry and warns him to leave the area. At Merripit House Watson learns that Stapleton used to be a schoolmaster 

Chapter 8 

Although Holmes requested just the facts, Watson begins his report with a description of the lonely and dismal ambiance on the moor. The escaped convict, Watson goes on, has likely fled the area as he couldn't survive for that long without food. Sir Henry appears to have developed a romantic interest in [Beryl Stapleton](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Beryl_Stapleton), and her brother does not seem to approve. Watson further reports that Sir Henry gave his old tweed suit to Barrymore to apologize for asking him for his whereabouts when Holmes's cable arrived. Watson is steadfast in his suspicion of Barrymore, whose wife continues to show signs of distress. [Dr. Watson](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Dr._Watson) also reports meeting Mr. Frankland, a friendly yet a litigious fellow who owns a telescope and watches the moor to look for the escaped convict. 

That same night Watson hears footsteps pass by his room and catches a glimpse of Barrymore slipping into a room on the second floor, a candle in hand 

Chapter 9  

. Two days have passed. Watson's second missive home reports that the room in which Barrymore disappeared directly overlooks the moor. Watson theorizes that Barrymore has an affair with a country girl, which would explain both his nightly endeavors and his wife's tears. Watson and Sir Henry plan a stakeout. 

Sir Henry meets [Beryl Stapleton](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/character-analysis/#Beryl_Stapleton) for a rendezvous. Watson follows him and observes that Beryl seems to resist his romantic overtures. Just as Sir Henry moves in to kiss her, her brother arrives and reacts with anger. Stapleton's reaction seems uncalled for given his sister is single and Sir Henry is a good catch. Later that evening Stapleton arrives at Barrymore Hall and apologizes for his outburst, inviting them to Merripit House for dinner. 

On the second night of their stakeout, Watson and Sir Henry follow Barrymore into the room overlooking the moor and confront him. When Barrymore refuses to provide an explanation, Watson grabs the candle and waves it to prove that Barrymore is signaling someone. A faint yellow light far out in the moor responds. Summoned by the commotion, Mrs. Barrymore shows up and reveals that the escaped convict is her younger brother, Selden, and that they are signaling him when they are ready to deliver food or clothes to him. 

Watson and Sir Henry head toward he faint light to catch the convict and bring him to the authorities, but he manages to escape. As they return to [Baskerville Hall](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/symbols/#Baskerville_Hall), Watson notices the silhouette of a tall man on top of a tor. 

Chapter 10 

On a dreary day Watson begins his diary excerpt by describing his sense of ever-present danger. As Holmes's surrogate he rejects the idea that his sense of foreboding might have a paranormal explanation, yet he cannot help but admit that the empirical realm offers no satisfying explanation for the fact that puzzles him: the howls that can be heard on the moor. 

Barrymore discloses that he read the charred remains of a letter delivered to Sir Charles the day he died, revealing that Sir Charles was supposed to meet a woman with the initials L.L. at 10 pm the night of his death. This new twist in the mystery prompts Watson to write a letter to Holmes and to admit that he wishes he were there. 

Although the next day is rainy and melancholy, Watson takes a stroll on the moor to ponder the case. He runs into Dr. Mortimer, who is looking for his lost spaniel. On a whim he asks about the initials from the letter they found, and Dr. Mortimer points him to Laura Lyons of nearby Coombe Tracey, who after an unhappy marriage was able to establish her typing business with Sir Charles's help. 

From Barrymore Watson learns that Selden has seen the man on the tor among the stone huts and considers him a gentleman. Watson, on the other hand, wonders about the hatred that must live in the sinister soul of a man who is willing to hide in as inhospitable a place as the stone huts. He decides that his new mission must be to uncover the identity of the mysterious man on the tor.
